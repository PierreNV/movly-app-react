		<h1 className="h3 mb-5 fw-normal">Welcome to Movly</h1>
		<p>Movly is a pure fictive react application intended to demonstrate some of my react JS knowledge aquired along my training.</p>
		<p>First, you want to create a user account that grants you access to a few extra functionalities such as adding movies to the database in the movies page. Some of these functionalities are admin only and might still appear disabled to you.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>API express</p>
		<p>As you probably noticed, I have used bootstrap for the style. It is minimalist and mobile first, it gives a consistent experience to the user on various medias.</p>

	</div>;

export default Home;
